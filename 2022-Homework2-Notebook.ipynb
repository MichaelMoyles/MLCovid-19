    "**This homework focuses on training and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset.**\n",
    "The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/). CDC is a USA health protection agency and is in charge of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, tracking cases, deaths, and trends of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC collects and makes public deidentified individual-case data on a daily basis, submitted using standardized case reporting forms. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we work with is a sample of the public data released by CDC, where the outcome for the target feature **death_yn** is known (i.e., either 'yes' or 'no'):\n",
    "https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this homework is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature **death_yn**. For this homework you are asked to use the same dataset allocated to you in Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models). To use the 2 individual files allocated for Homework1, you can merge them first, then clean the resulting dataset, before starting on Homework2 requirements.\n",

    "    - (1.1) Split the dataset into two datasets: 70% training and 30% test. Keep the test set aside. \n",
    "    - (1.2) On the training set:\n",
    "        - Plot the correlations between all the continuous features (if any). Discuss what you observe in these plots.\n",
    "        - For each continuous feature, plot its interaction with the target feature (a plot for each pair of   continuous feature and target feature). Discuss what you observe from these plots, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of continuous features you find promising (if any). Justify your choices.\n",

    "    - (2.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Threshold the predicted target feature value given by the linear regression model at 0.5, to get the predicted class for each example. Print the predicted class for the first 10 examples. Print a few classification evaluation measures computed on the full training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70%) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset). You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or repeated random train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and discuss your findings.\n",

    "(5). [25] **Improving Predictive Models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (5.1) Which model of the ones trained above performs better at predicting the target feature? Is it more   accurate than a simple model that always predicts the majority class (i.e., if 'no' is the majority class in your dataset, the simple model always predicts 'no' for the target feature)? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (5.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining predictive models, or using other domain knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice (with code), by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far. "

    "### Interpretation of the results\n",
    "- Highest correlations -  We will discuss the correlations found in the above heat map\n",
    "    - \"death_prob_medical\" and \"death_prob_sex_age\" have the highest correlation of 0.6. This is not surprising as the likelihood of hospitalisation will be related to the age of the person. Those that are hospitalised are likely to be older. \"death_prob_sex_age_median\" has the same correlation too. However, \"death_prob_medical_mean\" has a lower correlation than \"death_prob_medical\" with the other feature. The correlation is not high enough to drop either feature as they have a high enough independence from each other. There correlation with the target feature will be inspected in the next section of the project.\n",
    "    - \"death_prob_month\" and \"death_prob_sex_age\" have a correlation of 0.28. This is surprising as age and sex shouldn't be related to the month in which the case was recorded. It is not high enough to justify dropping either features. \"death_prob_sex_age_median\" has the same correlation too. We will review both of their correlation to the target value later in the project.\n",
    "    - \"death_prob_month\" and \"death_prob_medical\" have a correlation of 0.28. This is again surprising as medical treatment shouldn't be related to the month in which a case was reported. However, \"death_prob_medical_mean\" has a lower correlation than \"death_prob_medical\" again.\n",
    "- Weaker correlations - We can see a number of features with no apparent correlation to any other features\n",
    "    - \"case_positive_interval\" has a negligible correlation with the other features, we will consider dropping this as a feature after reviewing its correlation with the target feature"

    "### Interpretation of the results\n",
    "- Observing the plots, visually there are no clearly defined correlations and this is probably to be expected with a complex problem like this. There are many interactions to take into account.\n",
    "- Each correlation will be reviewed individually as there are only a few continuous features in the dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The strongest correlations are \"death_prob_medical\", \"death_prob_sex_age\" and  \"death_prob_sex_age_median\".\n",
    "    - death_prob_medical makes sense as a person that is hospitalised has a higher likelihood of death than a person not hospitalised as their case would have been deemed more severe. The imputed value has again, a much lower correlation, it will be reviewed again as a categorical value to determine the best course of action, it is unlikely to be dropped due to its importance.\n",
    "    - death_prob_sex_age has a high correlation with death, a person's age likely has a larger impact here on the correlation. death_prob_sex_age_median has a similar correlation value, a final decision will be made after reviewing it as a categorical value but a strong case for keeping the value as its imputation is being made by the results\n",
    "    - death_prob_month has a lower correlation but is still strong at 0.4, this feature will be kept\n",
    "- The weakest correlation is \"case_positive_specimen_interval\"\n",
    "    - This is unsurprising as the interval between the case was reported to the CDC and when the case was found is unlikely to effect the outcome of the patient. This feature should be removed as it will complicate the model, the impact of this decision will be evaluated in part 5."

    "- There is a wide variety of values between res_state and state_fips_code with death_yn. The feature will be kept but res_state and state_fips_code are duplications of each other so res_state will be dropped as a feature and state_fips_code will be kept as it a unique identifier of states. This will prevent duplication of data being inputted into the prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "death_yn vs res_county and county_fips_code\n",
    "- These features have too much data to inspect visually, upon review of the data quality report and from learnings from the data preparation stage these features will be dropped. The county level data is too granular, there is not enough instances per county to reliably predict the target feature, therefore to decomplexify the model these features will be dropped\n",
    "\n",
    "death_yn vs age_group\n",
    "- Each bin has different values that make intuitive sense, older cohorts died more than younger cohorts due to contracting Covid-19. Therefore the feature should be kept\n",

    "\n",
    "death_yn vs current_status\n",
    "- It is interesting to see that a probable case vs a laboratory confirmed case show little difference in death rates, these features will be kept as enough difference that it could be substantial for the prediction model\n",
    "\n",
    "death_yn vs symptom_status\n",
    "- It is interesting to see that the two values show little difference in death rates, we would have expected symptomatic cases to have a much higher level of deaths as intuitively a symptomatic case could be thought of as worse. These features will be kept as there is enough difference that it could be substantial for the prediction model and it will be interesting to see if they effect the model\n",
    "\n",

    "death_yn vs death_prob_sex_age\n",
    "- From this chart and the correlation chart we believe the feature's classification should be changed from categorical to continuous with the imputed value of death_prob_sex_age_median used as it will be easier to use in the model as a numeric value and has no values missing\n",

    "- 3 predictive models have been evaluated in this notebook, with all models preform similarly\n",
    "- The majority of the features in the dataset have been found to have little impact on the target\n",
    "- A number of optimisations have been made that have improved all models\n",

    "- The linear regression marginally preforms best but is not recommended as results could be skewed by valid outliers\n",
    "- The logistic and random forest models preform almost the same +/-1% and both could be used. \n",
    "- The logistic model is more lightweight and will be faster to retain, however provides marginally lower accuracy.\n",

    "#### Recommendations: \n",
    "1. Re-evaluate each model on the **whole** dataset\n",
    "2. Use the additional evaluation measures outlined in 5.6"
