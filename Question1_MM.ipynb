    "\n",
    "**This homework focuses on training and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset.**\n",
    "The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/). CDC is a USA health protection agency and is in charge of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, tracking cases, deaths, and trends of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC collects and makes public deidentified individual-case data on a daily basis, submitted using standardized case reporting forms. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we work with is a sample of the public data released by CDC, where the outcome for the target feature **death_yn** is known (i.e., either 'yes' or 'no'):\n",
    "https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this homework is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature **death_yn**. For this homework you are asked to use the same dataset allocated to you in Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models). To use the 2 individual files allocated for Homework1, you can merge them first, then clean the resulting dataset, before starting on Homework2 requirements.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are 5 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 25% shown as [25]. The total that can be achieved is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [25] **Data Understanding and Preparation:** Exploring relationships between feature pairs and selecting/transforming promising features based on a given training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (1.1) Split the dataset into two datasets: 70% training and 30% test. Keep the test set aside. \n",
    "    - (1.2) On the training set:\n",
    "        - Plot the correlations between all the continuous features (if any). Discuss what you observe in these plots.\n",
    "        - For each continuous feature, plot its interaction with the target feature (a plot for each pair of   continuous feature and target feature). Discuss what you observe from these plots, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of continuous features you find promising (if any). Justify your choices.\n",
    "        - For each categorical feature, plot its pairwise interaction with the target feature. Discuss what  knowledge you gain from these plots, e.g., which categorical features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of categorical features you find promising (if any). Justify your choices.\n",

    "    - (2.2) Print the coefficients learned by the model and discuss their role in the model (e.g., interpret the model by analysing each coefficient and how it relates each input feature to the target feature).    \n",
    "    - (2.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Threshold the predicted target feature value given by the linear regression model at 0.5, to get the predicted class for each example. Print the predicted class for the first 10 examples. Print a few classification evaluation measures computed on the full training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70%) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset). You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or repeated random train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and discuss your findings.\n",

    "(3). [15] **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic Regression.  \n",

    "(4). [20] **Predictive Modeling:** Random Forest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - (4.1) On the training set, train a random forest model to predict the target feature, using the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above.   \n",
    "    - (4.2) Can you interpret the random forest model? Discuss any knowledge you can gain in regard of the working of this model.   \n",
    "    - (4.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Print the predicted class for the first 10 examples. Print a few classification evaluation measures computed on the full training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (4.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set.

You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or repeated train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and to the Random Forest out-of-sample error and discuss your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(5). [25] **Improving Predictive Models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (5.1) Which model of the ones trained above performs better at predicting the target feature? Is it more   accurate than a simple model that always predicts the majority class (i.e., if 'no' is the majority class in your dataset, the simple model always predicts 'no' for the target feature)? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (5.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining predictive models, or using other domain knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice (with code), by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far. "
